# id_humpback_whales
Comparison of deep learning approaches in identifying humpback whales based on fin images.

The dataset used for was obtained from Kaggle. 
It contains thousands of images of humpback whale flukes.
Researchers have identified individual whales and given an identification (Id). 
The challenge is to predict the whale Id of images in the test set. This is a challenge because there are only a few examples for over 3,000 whale Ids.
