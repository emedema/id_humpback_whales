abstract = {In this study, AlexNet with transfer learning was employed to automatically detect and classify the sounds of killer whales, long-finned pilot whales, and harp seals with widely overlapping living areas. Transfer learning was used to overcome the overfitting problem of deep network as the training samples was insufficient. A challenging dataset containing both target (the three marine mammal sounds) and non-target (ambient noise including ship noise, pulse interference, and man-made sounds, etc) sounds collected from different recording times, locations and devices was used to examine the performance of the proposed method, and the sounds used in the test dataset were completely independent of the training dataset. The overall accuracy of the trained detection and classification models reached 99.96\% and 97.42\% respectively. Importantly, each trained model took only 1.3 ms to detect or classify a single image. Furthermore, feature visualizations and strongest activations demonstrated that the proposed method learns the true differences between different marine mammal sounds rather than differences between different recording environments and devices. Therefore, all results show that the proposed method has excellent performance and great potential for practical application.
•CNN is applied to detect and classify three marine mammal sounds.•High detection/classification accuracy and fast training/testing time.•Transfer learning solves the problem of insufficient training data and overfitting.•Feature visualization of the spectrogram from each class are presented.•Strongest activations demonstrate CNN can distinguish spectrograms.},

(eds.), Geo-informatics and Oceanography. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 105, pp. 129–133. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. A method based on data augmentation and transfer learning methods is proposed to address the problems of complicated steps, low accuracy, and poor generalization of traditional aquatic animal image classification methods. First, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network is used to enhance the data of the sample. Second, based on modifying the source model's fully connected classification layer, the weights of high-level convolution modules are set to be trained for adaptive adjustment. Finally, using the accuracy on the validation set and training time as the evaluation indexes, the performance experiments were conducted on various network structures and a different proportion of trainable parameters. The experimental results show that when the portion of trainable parameters is around 75%, the accuracy of the image recognition model obtained by retraining can reach 97.9%, which can be improved by up to 36 percentage points compared with the support vector machine algorithm.},
