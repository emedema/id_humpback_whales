abstract = {In this study, AlexNet with transfer learning was employed to automatically detect and classify the sounds of killer whales, long-finned pilot whales, and harp seals with widely overlapping living areas. Transfer learning was used to overcome the overfitting problem of deep network as the training samples was insufficient. A challenging dataset containing both target (the three marine mammal sounds) and non-target (ambient noise including ship noise, pulse interference, and man-made sounds, etc) sounds collected from different recording times, locations and devices was used to examine the performance of the proposed method, and the sounds used in the test dataset were completely independent of the training dataset. The overall accuracy of the trained detection and classification models reached 99.96\% and 97.42\% respectively. Importantly, each trained model took only 1.3 ms to detect or classify a single image. Furthermore, feature visualizations and strongest activations demonstrated that the proposed method learns the true differences between different marine mammal sounds rather than differences between different recording environments and devices. Therefore, all results show that the proposed method has excellent performance and great potential for practical application.
•CNN is applied to detect and classify three marine mammal sounds.•High detection/classification accuracy and fast training/testing time.•Transfer learning solves the problem of insufficient training data and overfitting.•Feature visualization of the spectrogram from each class are presented.•Strongest activations demonstrate CNN can distinguish spectrograms.},

  abstract = {Operating room (OR) scheduling is an important operational problem for most hospitals. In this study, we present a novel two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model to minimize total expected operating cost given that scheduling decisions are made before the resolution of uncertainty in surgery durations. We use this model to quantify the benefit of pooling ORs as a shared resource and to illustrate the impact of parallel surgery processing on surgery schedules. Decisions in our model include the number of ORs to open each day, the allocation of surgeries to ORs, the sequence of surgeries within each OR, and the start time for each surgeon. Realistic-sized instances of our model are difficult or impossible to solve with standard stochastic programming techniques. Therefore, we exploit several structural properties of the model to achieve computational advantages. Furthermore, we describe a novel set of widely applicable valid inequalities that make it possible to solve practical instances. Based on our results for different resource usage schemes, we conclude that the impact of parallel surgery processing and the benefit of OR pooling are significant. The latter may lead to total cost reductions between 21% and 59% on average.},

  abstract = {Operating Room (OR) Scheduling is one of the most critical problems at the operational level for hospital managers. A useful strategy for OR scheduling, especially in large hospitals is the block strategy. In this strategy, a specific time is blocked for each surgeon or surgical team. This strategy usually leads to unused operating rooms’ capacity. To overcome this problem, in this article, a novel modified block strategy is presented for the daily scheduling of elective patients. This study aims to find the optimal sequence and schedule of patients by minimizing the cost of overtime, makespan and completion time of surgeons’ operations by considering the resource constraints. Considering the limitations and real conditions of Al-Zahra Hospital, the largest educational hospital in Isfahan, Iran, is also an aspect of this study. The problem is modeled by mixed integer programming and Constraint Programming (CP). The performance of the models is verified by several random test instances. The results indicate that CP is more efficient than mathematical modeling in terms of the computational time for solving the considered problems, especially for large-size instances. The average percent of improvement in computational time is about 53% using the CP model. The proposed CP model is also used to solve real problem instances from Al-Zahra hospital. The results show that by using the CP model, the completion time of surgeons’ operations is shortened by 9% and ORs’ overtime and makespan objectives are reduced by 55% and 20% respectively.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a new algorithm for topological optimization under dynamic loading which combines cellular automata with bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO). The local rules of cellular automata are used to update the design variables, which avoids the difficulty of obtaining gradient information under nonlinear collision conditions. The intermediate-density design problem of hybrid cellular automata is solved using the BESO concept of 0-1 binary discrete variables. Some improvement strategies are also proposed for the hybrid algorithm to solve certain problems in nonlinear topological optimization, e.g. numerical oscillation. Some typical examples of crashworthiness problems are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method and its ability to find the final optimal solution. Finally, numerical results obtained using the proposed algorithms are compared with reference examples taken from the literature. The results show that the hybrid method is computationally efficient and stable.},
